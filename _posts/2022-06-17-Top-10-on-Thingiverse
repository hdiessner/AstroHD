I am so excited!
A couple of days ago, I published my Plug Covers on Thingiverse.
Today, I discovered, that now they are in the Top 10 of the "Popular Last 30 Days" designs hence, they are right on top of the Thingiverse landing page.
Never thought that such a simple design could make it to the top, but with more than 1200 likes it really seems to matter. I have to admit: I am pretty proud right now :)
